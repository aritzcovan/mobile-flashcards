# Mobile flashcards

We should all try to learn something new everyday. To help you do that, install this app on your phone and create a bunch of flash card decks to expand your mind.

clone this git repo to you local machine and run

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

you can use `npm` in place of yarn if you like.

Now, go forth and expand you mind!!

Thanks
